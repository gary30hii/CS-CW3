    "1. Choice of Hashing Algorithm – SHA-256 (SHA-2 Family)\n",
    "In our implementation, we chose SHA-256, a member of the SHA-2 family, as the hashing algorithm for password protection. According to the lecture on Cryptography (Lecture 8), SHA-256 was introduced in the revised Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-2) and produces a fixed-length 256-bit hash output regardless of input size.\n",
    "SHA-256 was selected because:\n",
    "It is currently considered secure and widely adopted in real-world systems.\n",
    "It provides strong one-way properties, meaning it is infeasible to recover the original password from its hash.\n",
    "It is resistant to collision attacks, which SHA-1 and MD5 are no longer secure against (as noted in the “Hash Algorithms” slide).\n",
    "This aligns with Lecture 8’s criteria for secure hash functions:\n",
    "The output should be deterministic but computationally infeasible to reverse (one-way property).\n",
    "It should be difficult to find two different messages with the same hash (collision resistance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implementation of Salting and Its Importance\n",
    "To further strengthen password storage, we introduced salting—a process where a random, unique string (salt) is added to each password before hashing.\n",
    "From the lecture on Authentication (Lecture 9), we understand that salting is vital because:\n",
    "It prevents attackers from using precomputed dictionary or rainbow table attacks, which rely on matching known password hashes.\n",
    "Even if two users choose the same password, the resulting hashes will be different due to the unique salt, making large-scale hash matching infeasible.\n",
    "In our approach:\n",
    "A cryptographically secure random salt is generated for each password using system randomness.\n",
    "The salt is concatenated with the password and the combination is hashed using SHA-256.\n",
    "Both the salt and the resulting hash are stored securely in the user database.\n",
    "This process is in line with what Lecture 9 explains under “Password Salting”: salting makes each password hash user-specific, and storing the salt does not reduce the security of the hash—it simply ensures uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Password Verification Process\n",
    "During login, the system:\n",
    "Retrieves the stored salt and hash associated with the user.\n",
    "Applies the same hashing process to the password entered by the user, using the stored salt.\n",
    "Compares the resulting hash with the stored one.\n",
    "If the hashes match, the user is authenticated successfully. If not, the login attempt fails.\n",
    "As stated in Lecture 8 under “Message Authentication Code (MAC)” and “Hash Functions”, this approach follows the principle of verifying data integrity by checking that the computed hash matches the original. Even though we do not use a MAC specifically, the process of comparing cryptographic hashes ensures that the password has not been altered and originates from the user."

    "1. System Design Overview\n",
    "Factor 1: Something the user knows (password)\n",
    "The user inputs a secret password stored in hashed and salted format.\n",
    "This corresponds to the classic knowledge-based authentication described in Lecture 9, where a password or PIN represents something the user remembers.\n",
    "Factor 2: Something the user has (OTP)\n",
    "Upon successful password verification, the system generates a one-time password (OTP) and simulates sending it to the user (e.g., via email).\n",
    "This represents possession-based authentication, a factor that relies on the user holding a device or token to receive the OTP.\n",
    "The OTP is randomly generated and changes every login attempt, making it resistant to replay attacks.\n",
    "2. Security Benefits of MFA Over Single-Factor Authentication\n",
    "Stronger Authentication Assurance:\n",
    " - MFA requires two independent pieces of evidence: knowing the correct password and having access to the OTP.\n",
    " - According to Lecture 9 (Slide: Multi-Factor Authentication), combining “something you know” and “something you have” increases confidence that the authentic user is logging in.\n",
    "Mitigates Password-Based Attacks:\n",
    " - Even if a password is compromised through phishing, guessing, or keylogging, an attacker cannot access the system without the second factor.\n",
    " - This defends against dictionary attacks and password reuse, which are common threats discussed in Lecture 9 (Slides: Guessing Passwords, Phishing, Spoofing).\n",
    "Prevents Replay and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:\n",
    " - Because the OTP changes each time, reused or intercepted passwords are ineffective without the new OTP.\n",
    " - This limits damage from credential stuffing or spoofing attacks as shown in Lecture 9 (Slides: Spoofing Attacks, Phishing).\n",
    "Reduces Impact of Stolen Credentials:\n",
    " - MFA ensures that even if a password file is leaked or cracked, access is still denied unless the attacker also gains access to the OTP mechanism.\n",
    " - This is aligned with Lecture 9’s suggestion that passwords alone are insufficient, especially against modern threats (Slide: More on Authentication)."
